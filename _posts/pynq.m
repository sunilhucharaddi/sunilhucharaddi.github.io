*PYNQ enables architects, engineers and programmers who design embedded systems to use Zynq devices, without having to use ASIC-style design tools to design programmable logic circuits.
*Programmable logic circuits are presented as hardware libraries called overlays
*A web-based architecture served from the embedded processors, and
The Jupyter Notebook framework deployed in an embedded context
