# Thoughts on hospitals and caring for parents
Following is my experience caring for my dad at a hospital where he underwent a surgery.

## Healthcare in Rural India
I had no real experience of healthcare system in place in India until this week. I came to know that very few people have health insurance in India apart from the very few who are employed/covered in the insurance of a family member who is employed. The graphic below gives an estimate. It is reflected at hospitals where many people choose to get operated in a government scheme for poor people(hospitals still charge some amount), these schemes are very popular, especially in rural districts and are very beneficial to people who do not have health insurance and cant afford hospital costs.

## Hospitals
There are different level of care at hospitals according to how much you want to shell out. The hospital we(dad and I) chose has four offerings not considering the free ward/scheme ward which costs little but has very poor care. The following image is from the hospital website advertising their facilities.

## Caring for Parents
I know this is a cliche but I'll say it any way. Caring for my dad gave me so much satisfaction of being there when he needed me. These 10 days were my bonding period with dad. Caring for your parents make you so close to them and its the first time the dependency is reversed. This dynamics makes it interesting, you see your parent suffer for the first time its hearbraking and moving at the same time. My dad tried to avoid taking my help as much as possible like he does when he's at home and sometimes he was worried more about my boredom than his health. I had to lie to him that I liked the solitude of the hospital and I could get some reading done which I think even he knew was a lie. I saw four kids die in two day time and a person lost his leg. All this amid the Corona virus scare which was starting to haunt me. The Buddhist first noble truth -"Existance is suffering" resonated with me during hospital days. But I dont feel it right now as am at my home , I guess you have to be suffering to understand buddhist philosophy:p
