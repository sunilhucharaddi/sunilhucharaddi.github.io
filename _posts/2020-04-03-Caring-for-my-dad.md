# Thoughts on hospitals and caring for parents
Following is my experience caring for my dad at a hospital where he underwent a surgery.

## Healthcare in Rural India
I had no real experience of healthcare system in place in India until this week. I came to know that very few people have health insurance in India apart from the very few who are employed/covered in the insurance of a family member who is employed. The graphic below gives an estimate. It is reflected at hospitals where many people choose to get operated in a government scheme for poor people(hospitals still charge some amount), these schemes are very popular, especially in rural districts and are very beneficial to people who do not have health insurance and cant afford hospital costs.

## Hospitals
There are different level of care at hospitals according to how much you want to shell out. The hospital we(dad and I) chose has four offerings not considering the free ward/scheme ward which costs little but has very poor care. The following image is from the hospital website advertising their facilities.
