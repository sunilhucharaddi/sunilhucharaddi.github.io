**Video Transmission On OAI using Sockets**
following shows the flow of the process
1. Create the socket and open it in the nr-softmodem file because this file is the driver file for all the functions. This one time thing.
2. Create a way to write into the buffer of physical layer every time you transmit the data. This is basically taking data from the socket buffer and writing it into TBS_something buffer in gnbschedulerphytest 
3. Do the opposite on the UE side take data that arrives in llprocbuf and copy it into socket buffer
4. open the socket and read from the buffer into vlc  etc
