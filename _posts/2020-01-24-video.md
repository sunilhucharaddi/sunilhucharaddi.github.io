**Notes on Video Transmission On OAI using Sockets(discussion with rahul)**

following shows the flow of the process as explained bby rahul

1. Create the socket and open it in the nr-softmodem file because this file is the driver file for all the functions. This is one time thing.
2. Create a way to write into the buffer of physical layer every time you transmit the data. This is basically taking data from the socket buffer and writing it into TBS_something buffer in gnbschedulerphytest 
3. Do the opposite on the UE side take data that arrives in llprocbuf in the nr_dlsch_decoding.c file and copy it into socket buffer
4. open the socket(which has been written in nrue-softmodem.c, this is the driver file for UE) and read from the buffer into vlc  etc.

Some other things:\n
1. cscope is a tool to search for files from parent directory of git repo
2. ctag is a tool to open into a function or variable type etc
2. vi is vim.and check vim rc to edit controls
